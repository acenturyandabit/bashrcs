# bashrcs

This is a collection of my personal `.bashrc` files. I was previously using github gists, but gists' source control only shows diffs, not the whole file, whereas you can use git to see whole past versions of a file.

## Usage

Clone this repo to your home directory, then add `source ~/bashrcs/.bashrc.*` to your `.bashrc` file. You can of course only source the files you want.
